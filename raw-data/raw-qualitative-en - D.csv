D-3,interviewer,"Doctor, can you tell me something for confirmation?"
D-4,interviewee,Aioi.
D-5,interviewer,"Let us begin. First of all, I don't know who else is doing the research, so please tell me what your role is here in the Department of General Medicine."
D-6,interviewee,"One is to manage the ward as a whole, since I am the chief of the ward, and the other is to be directly involved with the early trainees, which I have been doing for the past six months."
D-7,interviewer,Thank you very much. How long have you been here?
D-8,interviewee,I've been at the university for about 12 years.
D-9,interviewer,"That's quite a long time. First of all, what are your thoughts on evaluation in general?"
D-10,interviewee,Are you talking about the evaluation of residents?
D-11,interviewer,Something a little more general would be fine.
D-12,interviewee,"I think it is important to be able to see what you are trying to evaluate. For example, if you are evaluating a resident, it is important to be able to see what aspect of the resident you are trying to evaluate from the chart, and to be able to see it when you are adding the information."
D-13,interviewee,The other thing is that it is not too long. It should not take a long time.
D-14,interviewee,"Also, if there is too much of a discrepancy between the general impression of the resident, or even the late resident, and the level of evaluation on the evaluation chart, it can be unpleasant."
D-15,interviewer,Is it possible that there is a discrepancy?
D-16,interviewee,"Yes, I think there is a divergence. If there is a discrepancy between what we are looking for in residents and what we are looking for in someone else, and what we are looking for in the evaluation form, there will inevitably be a discrepancy between the impression of the evaluation result and the evaluation result."
D-17,interviewer,"I see. Thank you very much. Please tell us about your own past evaluations, and what kind of evaluations you have experienced, both for the person doing the evaluation and the person being evaluated."
D-18,interviewee,"I think I'm from a generation that hasn't had much experience with direct evaluation. I don't think I've ever been evaluated on more than the level of whether or not I have a certain knowledge, rather than through tests or free-text evaluations."
D-19,interviewee,"My experience in evaluation, especially in terms of educational evaluation, is that I have been evaluating residents and majoring physicians since I came to Nagoya University in 2009."
D-20,interviewer,"Thank you very much. Let's move on to this topic. This is one of the things I'm asking you to do. I've brought this here for your reference, so please take a look at it and let me know what you think about it."
D-21,interviewee,"I think that the evaluation is quite multifaceted, and especially in the item 2 of the research evaluation table, it is rather clear what level to check and how much to check, so I think it is easy to apply, and I think it is good in that it is multifaceted."
D-22,interviewee,"However, there is not much in the way of evaluation items such as how you have been involved in medical treatment or something, how you have been involved and faced problems, and how you have endured them. If you are doing what you are told to do to a certain extent, and if you can do desk work, your evaluation will be somewhat high. I think they don't appreciate the toughness to face the patient's problem and find the problem and solve it while suffering."
D-23,interviewer,I see. What is it about that in particular?
D-24,interviewee,"I don't think that people appreciate the fact that you find problems on your own, for example. It seemed to me that if someone told you to do something and you did some research on it, you would get a good evaluation."
D-25,interviewer,Thank you very much.
D-26,interviewee,"In the evaluation table 3, there are some things that could be evaluated if you wanted to, but in the evaluation table 2, which takes up a lot of space, I didn't really feel that part."
D-27,interviewer,"As you mentioned, there are three major parts, 1, 2, and 3, but how do these three parts differ from the teacher's point of view?"
D-28,interviewee,"The first part is basically attitude. As for the third, I understand it as a general evaluation. That's how I interpreted it from the letter."
D-29,interviewer,"From your point of view, what are the strengths and weaknesses of this evaluation method?"
D-30,interviewee,"From your point of view, what are the strengths and weaknesses of this method of evaluation? In terms of strengths, I think the multifaceted nature of evaluation is a strength, but I am not sure. For example, in the case of young doctors in particular, I think we need to properly evaluate their positive vectors, such as whether they are getting closer to being able to do something, rather than whether they are able to do something. I think we need to change our approach accordingly."
D-31,interviewee,"In terms of the evaluation to determine the pass/fail line, I think I've got it down pretty comprehensively."
D-32,interviewee,"I want to properly evaluate children who are trying their best, even if they are not doing well, and I want to evaluate children who are facing the challenges properly, and I think such children can be expected to grow afterwards."
D-33,interviewer,"If you were to fill in these gaps, what kind of evaluation chart would you use?"
D-34,interviewee,"On the other hand, if you break it down into smaller parts, the evaluation results may not match the actual feeling. On the other hand, if you break it down into smaller parts, the evaluation results may not match the actual feeling, so it may be better to use a general evaluation. So I think a general evaluation might be good, like whether I was involved in this way or not. How many levels are there? If we do that, the evaluation of whether or not each individual was involved will change, so we may have to adjust that."
D-35,interviewer,Thank you very much. This is the other evaluation chart. What are your thoughts on this one as well?
D-36,interviewee,"I thought this was more of an evaluation of whether there was a problem or not. To be honest, I didn't really feel that the evaluation items were assessing the degree of the evaluator. It was more like, ""This girl is like this,"" and I couldn't really tell if she was capable or if she was inferior. I felt that I couldn't get much variation in the people I had assigned."
D-37,interviewee,"I think a child who refuses to give feedback is a big problem, and that would be one of the above two, but I don't think there is a clear standard for the difference between the two, like this child is higher because of this, and this child is lower because of this."
D-38,interviewee,"In terms of looking back, I already knew from the beginning that some of the choices were different, and I didn't really have an intention to choose one of the top two, but rather I just sort of chose it."
D-39,interviewer,I see. Thank you very much. This is also relatively divided into the first half and the second half.
D-40,interviewee,What did you entrust them with?
D-41,interviewer,What are the differences in this area from your point of view?
D-42,interviewee,"Especially in the comment section at the back, I would like to know what I have entrusted to the resident, and what he or she is able to do, rather than writing it thinking that he or she is able to do it before writing it, but after seeing this, I would like to know that he or she is able to do it. Rather than thinking that I should be able to do this before I write it, I just thought that I could do it after seeing it. I didn't want to be too rigid about it. I remember that I wrote about the same thing in the section on how to improve this."
D-43,interviewer,"Thank you very much. From your point of view, what are the strengths and weaknesses of this evaluation chart?"
D-44,interviewee,"Rather than using it as an evaluation form for the residents, I used it to see if I was paying attention to these aspects and to find out what problems the residents had. In the case of the last choice, I didn't so much write down how the resident was doing, but rather, I wrote down the ones that were clearly different, and the ones that weren't. I didn't feel that I had much intention in writing them down."
D-45,interviewee,"Rather, when I was writing in the free space in the back, I thought, ""Oh, this child is like this."
D-46,interviewer,"Thank you very much. Comparing the two evaluation charts, what are the differences from your point of view?"
D-47,interviewee,"I thought that the localized one was pretty easy to fill out, although I didn't feel like I was differentiate the residents with this one. As for the analysis of the factors that the residents were able to do and were not able to do, general rubrics has a better analysis of each factor, and it clearly shows the level of each factor. In most cases, I had to choose one of the three levels. In that sense, the global version is more evaluative, while localized version is more like, I wonder if this is enough to evaluate."
D-48,interviewer,What are the differences in the impact of these two evaluation tables? Is there any difference in the impact between the two evaluation charts?
D-49,interviewee,For what?
D-50,interviewer,Is there any difference in the impact on the supervisor or the resident?
D-51,interviewee,"I haven't really thought about it that much. I'm not really sure about the difference in impact. At least with Google, I can review what the residents were doing and what they were able to do at that time, but not yet in this way. In this sense, I was able to review what I hadn't done yet."
D-52,interviewee,"In this case, I was more concerned with checking the abilities of the residents at the time, but I didn't think there was much I could do about that. For example, if a person's level of involvement in the overall medical treatment was not very high, whether or not to let him or her get involved would depend largely on his or her own initiative. However, when a resident do not have motivation, I don't have much motivation to provide a instruction for residents to develop their abilities. I don't think there will be any change in the teaching methods because of the level of performance."
D-53,interviewer,What part of the evaluation do you think the difference comes from?
D-54,interviewee,"I think it's the free text section. If there are no memorable episodes that fall far short of my expectations, I don't think I would write much. There are a lot of items, I work hard to fill in the items on the assessment sheet and don't write much comments. If you are expecting a free space, you need to set up a separate space for free space, but I think it is difficult to check the free space due to the nature of the evaluation sheet."
D-55,interviewer,"If you have any additional comments about this evaluation or the evaluation in general, please let me know."
D-56,interviewee,"I think it would be good if the evaluation itself could reflect in some way those who are working hard, who are still immature in terms of ability, but who are working hard and can be expected to develop their ability from here, and those who may find it difficult to do so. I think it would be good to reflect this in the evaluation itself in some way. Of course, there are many children in the hospital who are trying their best but have a different direction. I think it would be good if we could do something about that."
D-57,interviewee,"It may not be a good idea to have a preconceived notion of what a resident is like, but I think it is necessary to share the evaluation results with the next supervisor, even though it is not related to the evaluation chart."
D-58,interviewer,"I feel that there are both good and bad aspects when such information is shared, so what do you think could happen?"
D-59,interviewee,"I think it would be better for the students to know that they had a good reputation, so that when they go to the next department, we can put more effort into them. I don't think it's necessary to say that something that had a bad reputation had a bad reputation. If there are no rumors that the reputation was good, there may be some disadvantages. If a resident has worked hard at various places, it would be better for the resident to be able to share the information about how he or she worked hard here."
D-60,interviewer,"If you were to create an evaluation based on this kind of information, what do you think would be necessary?"
D-61,interviewee,"This may be a little off topic, but I thought that the contents of the assessment items were quite abstract, and it was difficult to apply them by changing the level of abstraction from the actual activities of the learner. I felt that it would be better to lower the level of abstraction of the evaluation items. I felt that it would be easier to evaluate it that way. It may be completely different. I think there were three points: the difficulty in attaching the items, the way of sharing the information, and the treatment for the items that were not evaluated as mentioned earlier. I think there are three points that need to be improved: the way the contents of the items are explained. I'm sorry, I'm not sure."
D-62,interviewer,"Thank you very much. I'm sorry, I'm only asking about things that are difficult to answer. What you answered was that your thoughts on evaluation in general, and your thoughts on this and that, are relatively comprehensive and analytical and allow us to make judgments, but on the other hand, they don't lead us to what we should do next. On the other hand, while it is possible to make relatively comprehensive and analytical judgments, it is difficult to make decisions about what to do next. Finally, as a future direction, he said that it would be better to lower the level of abstraction of the description. Is there anything you would like to add, or did I just make a mistake?"
D-63,interviewee,"No, not particularly. I don't think there is anything wrong either. Thank you very much for your summary."
D-64,interviewer,Thank you very much. I'm sorry. It's hard to answer all these questions.
D-65,interviewee,"But that's the way it is, isn't it? Yes, I think it's good."
D-66,interviewer,Thank you very much. I'm going to finish. Thank you very much.
