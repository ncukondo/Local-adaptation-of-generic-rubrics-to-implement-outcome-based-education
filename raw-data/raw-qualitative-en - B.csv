B-3,interviewer,"First of all, for the sake of the interview, can you tell us what kind of work you are doing now?"
B-4,interviewee,"At the moment, I'm working in the Department of General Medicine at Nagoya University Hospital, managing the wards, doing outpatient work, and occasionally going to work outside the hospital."
B-5,interviewer,"How long have you been here, doctor?"
B-6,interviewee,"This is my second year as a resident, but I also did my residency at Nagoya University Hospital, so this is my fourth year at Nagoya University Hospital."
B-7,interviewer,"What do you mean by ""student"", doctor, at Nagoya University?"
B-8,interviewee,I went to university in Fukui.
B-9,interviewer,Is it because you came here with that?
B-10,interviewee,I came here for the study group Accel's Gifu or something like that.
B-11,interviewer,"I felt like you've been here for a long time, so that's how it was. Can you tell me what your current relationship with the residents is like?"
B-12,interviewee,"For the wards, there are always one, two, or three residents coming around, so I work with them as a team to see patients. As for outpatients, I am not in a position to directly supervise residents, so I don't have much to do with them, but I might talk to them if they ask for advice at outpatient conferences."
B-13,interviewer,"I would like to ask you about evaluation in this interview, but first of all, can you tell me what you think about evaluation?"
B-14,interviewee,Do you mean the evaluations I receive? Or is it the evaluation I give to the residents?
B-15,interviewer,Either is fine.
B-16,interviewee,"The evaluations I give to the residents are either written on paper for each term, or I give them verbal feedback on the spot when they ask me questions or do things for me in their daily work. I get feedback from the residents in the department of general medicine, such as how many points they received for this item or free comments they received. As for my own evaluation, I have regular reviews with Dr. Kondo, and in terms of my daily ward duties, I have ward conferences twice a day where I directly receive questions from Dr. Motoki, other residents, interns, and students about how I am doing.　I am aware that I am receiving specific feedback from them."
B-17,interviewer,What do you think the meaning of evaluation is?
B-18,interviewee,"One is that as a doctor, you have to make sure that you are not an outlier, that you are not just an outlier in terms of academic ability, but also in terms of your personality and how you are viewed by others. I think it is an opportunity for me to understand how I am perceived by others."
B-19,interviewer,Is that also true for the residents?
B-20,interviewee,"I think so, and I also thought so when I was a resident. Whether it was a good evaluation or a bad evaluation, I thought that this is how it is in reality, or this is how I look to others, and that is how I did it."
B-21,interviewer,"You just touched on this a little bit, but could you tell us a little bit about your relationship with your past evaluations?"
B-22,interviewee,"When I was a resident, I received evaluations when I was a resident, and I remember that I stumbled here, or that I was confused or troubled at that time, and I remember that other people gave me such evaluations. When I saw the evaluations, I thought that the children of today would probably stumble in this area as well, and that it would have been nice to have been told these things in advance. So, as a supervising physician, or as a person who can be involved, I try to anticipate what is going to happen, not to tell you, but to tell you in my own way."
B-23,interviewer,Is there anything else you would like to tell us so far?
B-24,interviewee,"No, not really."
B-25,interviewer,"I'd like to ask about the evaluation forms. I have brought this with me, but it is an evaluation form used nationwide."
B-26,interviewee,"The first part of the resident evaluation form, the general comments, can be written roughly, so I think it is easy to write, but the second part, the one that can be evaluated in more detail on seven levels, can be written roughly, but when you say seven levels, it is difficult to know where to put it. I check all the items for the time being, but sometimes I'm not sure whether I should put them on the list or not, because I haven't had a chance to observe them. I'm not sure if I've observed this or not. ......"
B-27,interviewer,Can you be a little more specific?
B-28,interviewee,"For example, recognizing conflicts of interest and responding to them in accordance with the management policy, I think that conflicts of interest are considered only when a situation where a conflict of interest arises, or if there is a case where you think it is likely to happen, you would consider it. But if it doesn't turn out to be such a case in the first place and it just slips away, there is no opportunity to evaluate it, but if there are three or four other evaluation items, for example, three of the five evaluation items in medical ethics are about this level, but one is not evaluated at all, or if it turns out to be a little negative, where do you put it?　So I kind of give them a fluffy overall rating and write comments for the ones I really like, but I'm not sure if this is the right way to give them. Also, especially in the fields of health and welfare, if a person is not involved to that extent, but is just hospitalized, discharged, and returns to the same life as before, there may not be a case to evaluate. I'm not sure if it's okay to put it on, but I do it for some reason. I think it's a bit detailed, because there are seven items, and for each item there are three or four more detailed evaluation items, so I appreciate the fact that there are so many items, but in the end I don't know where to put them. I guess that's how I feel."
B-29,interviewer,"You said that the first one was easy to put on, but can you tell us more about it?"
B-30,interviewee,"The first one says levels 1, 2, 3, and 4, and you can softly write in four levels with those four questions, and the levels 1, 2, 3, and 4 are as expected, whether they are above, below, or if they are below, by how much. So, it's not a matter of giving them this score because they were able to do this specifically, but rather, it's a matter of giving them a 3 if they were able to meet the standards that other residents, in general, would be able to meet. On the second and subsequent pages, there are seven criteria for 5, and the middle one is 5, but how do you differentiate between 4, 6, and other subtle differences?　In the end, I didn't really understand how to differentiate between subtle differences such as a 4 or a 6."
B-31,interviewer,"So, what are the good points of this evaluation form?"
B-32,interviewee,"Is it the first one, or the second one?"
B-33,interviewer,It would be helpful if you could tell me everything.
B-34,interviewee,"The good thing about the first one, the Resident Evaluation Form 1, is that you don't have to worry about it too much and can just put it on intuitively or quickly. It's a good point. So, even though they are both in the middle, it is good to be able to check for minor changes, such as a child who was in the bottom of the middle at first, but by the second term, he or she is in the top of the middle."
B-35,interviewer,There are three of these at .......
B-36,interviewee,"Resident Evaluation Form 3 is the same as 1. There is a level 3, which is the middle standard, and you can either go beyond it or not. For level 3 in particular, whether it can be done under the direct supervision of the supervising physician, or whether it can be done in a situation where it can be handled immediately without direct supervision, the levels 1, 2, 3, and 4 are divided quite concretely, so I think evaluation form 3 is the easiest among the three."
B-37,interviewer,"On the other hand, are there any problems with this evaluation form?"
B-38,interviewee,"For assessment sheet 1, I don't understand what expectations are.　I don't know what the expectations are, so if I were to assign it to first-year residents, I would assume that Level 3 would be the minimum level of misbehavior among first-year residents that I could tolerate, but I don't know if that's how other people assign it. In this sense, both evaluation sheets 1 and 3 are roughly the same level. In that sense, both evaluation sheets 1 and 3 are too rough, or rather, when we say that a child is at Level 3 from Level 3, it looks like the child has not changed at all, which is not good. On the evaluation sheet 2, the detailed one, I can write down the detailed changes, but as I said before, when I wonder where to put the detailed ones, which are good for this one point, but not so good for this one point, I wonder if I should take a break between them or just put them on the good side. I don't know if I should just give it to them and comment on what I like about it."
B-39,interviewer,"Most of the comments were about the level classification here, but do you have any comments about the content of the items here?"
B-40,interviewee,"I don't think anything is wrong with the first item on the evaluation form, and I think that's about right, but with regard to the third item on the evaluation form, as I mentioned earlier, I don't have many opportunities to interact with residents in general outpatient clinics, so it's a little difficult to evaluate them without having seen them. I think it is a little difficult to evaluate them without seeing them. I can look at other initial emergency and ward care, and I think it is a little difficult to look at community medicine in that sense. If I was involved in community collaboration during hospitalization, I could write it down, so I think it's okay, but I wasn't involved in outpatient care at all, so I think that's a gray area. As I mentioned in the middle of the evaluation form 2, there are 5 more detailed items in the evaluation form 2, for example, ethics in medicine and medical care.　I think all of the items are important, but I wonder if there are so many items that residents need to know about, such as ......, and there are a lot of items that I don't get involved with or don't have a chance to observe, so I wonder if there are so many evaluation items. I wonder if there are so many evaluation items."
B-41,interviewer,Do you have any other comments on the evaluation form in general?
B-42,interviewee,I think I have said most of what I wanted to say.
B-43,interviewer,"Next, let's talk about this evaluation form. First of all, please tell us what you think about this evaluation form."
B-44,interviewee,"This is an evaluation form that you can fill out online with your cell phone, right? I think online is easier because it's just a click away, and it's not so different from check sheets. As for the evaluation items, there are usually three or four options to choose from, so I don't have to worry too much about it."
B-45,interviewee,"What I also like about it is that I can write freely. There is a section that asks the residents to write down the specific tasks that they were able to do during their rotations, and there is also a section that asks the residents to tell us what we can do better to help them grow in the future."
B-46,interviewee,"When I was a resident, that's exactly what I wanted to hear. I thought that if I could receive feedback on how I could do better each time I finished a department, it would make it easier for me to use that information to move on to other departments. I remember that we didn't receive such evaluations every term. It's not too difficult to do."
B-47,interviewer,"You've covered a lot of ground, but when you compare the evaluation form with this one, what do you think the differences would be?"
B-48,interviewee,"Can you give us an idea? The localized version is more specific and the level of the evaluation is not ambiguous. For example, in the case of item 5 (reporting, communication, and consultation), there are three choices: able to report and consult at an appropriate frequency, not able to report and consult, and never had the opportunity to do so, so there is no confusion."
B-49,interviewee,"But on the resident evaluation form, whether it's 1, 2, or 3 on paper, to put it bluntly, I feel that my evaluation can vary quite a bit depending on my mood."
B-50,interviewee,"Also, the comments. I get the impression that the comments are more positive in localized tools. It's easier to write comments because it says ""please comment on what would be good to do."
B-51,interviewee,"In the evaluation forms 1, 2, and 3, it says that if there is a memorable episode, please describe it, so it is okay to write good things, but after that, it says that if the episode falls far short of expectations, please be sure to write it."
B-52,interviewer,Do you think this kind of difference has any effect on the growth of residents?
B-53,interviewee,"I think it would be better to have an evaluation that is simple to understand. If the evaluation is blurred by the senior doctor's mood of the day, it would be difficult to know what to believe."
B-54,interviewer,"Comparing the two, is there anything else you want to say?"
B-55,interviewee,I think I have said most of what I wanted to say.
B-56,interviewer,I think that evaluation is an area that we need to think about not only here but also in the future.
B-57,interviewee,"What do you expect from evaluation in the future? It could be yourself or the person you evaluate, but I think it would be good if the person you evaluate or the person who is evaluated become better through evaluation. I think it would be good if the person doing the evaluation and the person being evaluated become better. You can write good or bad things, but in the end, I think it's good if the person who receives the evaluation becomes better. I think it would be good if the doctor, the person who teaches, and the person who evaluates become better."
B-58,interviewer,"So, what you are saying is that the people who provide the guidance will also benefit from the evaluation?"
B-59,interviewee,"Yes, I do. If you know that you're going to put these items, you'll know that you have to pay attention to these things, and you'll be able to compare your child's performance with other people's, instead of just casually wondering if he's doing well. I can tell if he's doing well or not, and if I should give him advice on how to do better."
B-60,interviewer,"As a teacher, what do you think is important for such evaluation?"
B-61,interviewee,"You mean for evaluation to get better? I'm not very good at complicated things or trying to figure out what to do in a soft gray area, so I want to know if it's good or bad, and if it's not, I'd be very happy if you tell me in a constructive way what to do about it. So I personally think it would be great if the evaluations were short, easy to understand, and not too confusing."
B-62,interviewer,Do you have any further comments about your expectations for future evaluations?
B-63,interviewee,"Maybe you're working on it now, but when you're making evaluation items, you should ask the new people who are doing the evaluation, like us, what kind of problems they've had.　For example, when we were making the evaluation items, we asked the newcomers what problems they had encountered and what problems they were facing when teaching.　I think it would help me become better at teaching and it would also help the residents grow."
B-64,interviewer,Is there anything else you would like to add?
B-65,interviewee,"No, thank you."
B-66,interviewer,"I will summarize what we talked about, so if you have anything to add, please let me know. First of all, I asked the teacher to share her current position, and then I asked her to tell me about the evaluations she has done so far, her image of evaluation, and her image of being able to know how others see her. After that, I asked them to evaluate the national evaluation forms here. He said that he liked the fact that the resident evaluation forms 1 and 3 could be filled in pretty much by feel. One of the good points is that the items are not too detailed. On the other hand, if you are not sure, there is no place where you can put the items that are either in the middle of the pack or in the bottom of the pack. The second part of the resident evaluation form is too detailed, and there are some items that require observation and some that do not, so it is very difficult to decide where to put the items. Another thing he said to me afterwards was that the sentence for the free comments here might lead to negative comments. As for the problem here, the items are simple and not too confusing, and the free comments are good because they tend to invite positive comments. Also, I would have liked something like this if I had been there. As for expectations for future evaluations, it would be good to have evaluations that not only help residents grow, but also help supervisors become better at teaching. In order to achieve this, he suggested that it would be a good idea to involve the supervisors themselves in the evaluation process. Is there anything that you would like to add, anything that is a little different, or anything that you would like to leave out?"
B-67,interviewee,"No, nothing in particular. I think it's fine."
B-68,interviewer,Thank you very much for your time today. This is very helpful.
B-69,interviewee,Thank you very much.
B-70,interviewer,"Actually, there was a part where I wrote about the improvements I wanted to make in the future, and I thought very hard about it. I just found out that it was all deleted."
B-71,interviewee,"So they were deleted. I always thought that I didn't understand the evaluation at all. It's true that the number of cases doesn't go up to a certain number of terms, but if you send in a little bit, you get a score, but it's like a five-point scale, like an elementary school double circle, circle, and cross, so I didn't really understand it."
B-72,interviewer,"At least in the department of general medicine, we all worked hard to think of comments and write them down, but when they were deleted, we felt a sense of despair that they were not conveyed."
B-73,interviewee,It makes you feel like you've put in all that effort.
B-74,interviewer,It's very frustrating.
B-75,interviewee,Why does it get deleted? Is it because they might be disappointed?
B-76,interviewer,It's a simple reason. It's because I can't keep up with the paperwork.
B-77,interviewee,You mean someone was transcribing all the evaluations for you?
B-78,interviewer,"The paper ones were rewritten into Excel, and that's how it happened. So, that sense of despair was one of the starting points for me to do something about this, this kind of evaluation."
B-79,interviewee,"Is this one disappearing, too, the one you're writing now?"
B-80,interviewer,That's going to disappear.
B-81,interviewee,It disappears. I was working very hard on it.
B-82,interviewer,This one won't disappear.
B-83,interviewee,I was writing this.
B-84,interviewer,"I was looking at it, but it disappears. What impressed me a lot this year was that everyone worked very hard on their writing, and they all wrote their free comments very well. This year, I was quite impressed by how hard they wrote and how well they wrote their free comments."
B-85,interviewee,"It's difficult. It would be easier if I could access them with this, but as I said earlier, if I could type them in an Excel file like a family log, it would be easier if I could keep them. I think it's possible to do that nowadays, but I don't know if it's possible."
B-86,interviewer,"There are still some left, though. But there's too much for me to keep track of."
B-87,interviewee,That makes it hard for me. I guess that's what happens when you're evaluated by various teachers.
B-88,interviewer,"The children who are going around a lot right now are being evaluated at a very high rate, and they are being evaluated by the supervisors, by the head nurses, by the patients, and it's pretty good data, but sometimes there are great comments, like there is no growth potential, and I can't tell them directly."
B-89,interviewee,That's true.
B-90,interviewer,"But when I look at them, I think that if we do this properly, it will be very good for both the supervisors and the residents, as you said."
B-91,interviewee,"I'm wondering if it would make a difference if we were to put the evaluation sheets on a single piece of paper with everyone discussing them, or if we were to give an average score to the sheets that everyone put together. If I remember correctly, in the general medicine department, we used to write down one score while discussing with everyone. In that case, while we were discussing, I thought this girl was really good, but other doctors thought she was not good enough, and I wondered if my evaluation was too lenient. It's an opportunity to get feedback. However, in a sense, it can be good or bad, but it is better for each person to give their own evaluation, so as not to discourage the minority who say, ""No, actually, there were some good points. I think it's easier to pick up good opinions if you give them to each individual, but in the end, I think it's better to give them an average score in order to keep the quality in the eyes of everyone."
B-92,interviewer,"Actually, this is the cutting edge of what I'm studying right now, and the evaluation from Shimotome Sensei and the evaluation from Motoki Sensei have different meanings. It's not as if you can just average them out."
B-93,interviewee,That's true. It's difficult.
B-94,interviewer,"On the other hand, it is necessary to average them in order to make judgments, so how can I get the best out of them?"
B-95,interviewee,"But when I'm giving out evaluation forms, I often wonder if the way I'm giving out evaluations is good enough."
B-96,interviewer,"I think it's important to get feedback on that. I'm using Excel, or rather a spreadsheet, for this as well, just like the Familog. But the data is so huge that it's not so much that it's hard to compile, but rather that we can't all read it afterwards, because it's too much. How to put it all together is a theme for the future, though. But I am grateful for the time."
B-97,interviewee,"But I think. I don't have confidence in teaching, so I always pretend that I'm teaching, but I'm putting it on as if I'm getting my own evaluation, which I'm not. When I don't get feedback on myself, I get a little anxious. I'm always wondering if I'm doing the right thing. When I'm instructing a resident, and there's a more senior doctor right behind me, it's hard to do, but later, for example, when I tell him that he should have said something like this, or that I instructed him in this way, he can say something like, ""Oh, that's good. When I told him that I gave him this kind of instruction, he would say, ""Oh, that's good."" If he said something like that, I would understand that it was good. What happened to that?　I've been thinking about it up to this point, but now I've asked the resident to think about it this way, and he said, ""Let's do it this way. They were like, ""That's good, that's good, that's good, that's good, let me do it, let me do it,"" and I was able to get feedback from them that it was okay to let the resident do this much, and that it was okay that I judged that it would not be a big deal if it went this far. I was able to get feedback from them. I'm grateful for that kind of feedback, but if I were asked to turn it into an evaluation form, it might be a little difficult, but it's quite fun, and I'm grateful for it. That's how I feel."
B-98,interviewer,"Thank you very much, professor."
B-99,interviewee,
